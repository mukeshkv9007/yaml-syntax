### NUMERIC
## The key is always a string. The value is a scalar so that it can be any datatype.
---
foo: 12345
bar: 0x12d4
plop: 023332
#An integer can be decimal, hexidecimal, or octal
---
foo: 1230.15
bar: 12.3015e+05
# YAML supports both fixed and exponential floating point numbers.

---
foo: .inf
bar: -.Inf
plop: .NAN
#Finally, we can represent not-a-number (NAN) or infinity.

### STRING
## YAML strings are Unicode. In most situations, you don't have to specify them in quotes.

foo: this is a normal string
bar: "this is not a normal string\n" #if we want escape sequences handled, we need to use double quotes.

#Chomp Modifiers
#Multiline values may end with whitespace, 
#and depending on how you want the document to be processed you might not want to preserve it. YAML has the strip chomp and preserve chomp operators. To save the last character, add a plus to the fold or block operators.
